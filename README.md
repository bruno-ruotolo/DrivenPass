## About

Have you ever thought about saving all your passwords in one place and not worrying about memorizing them all? This application will help you with that. 
With DrivenPass we can save our credential data from websites, cards, wifi and even secure notes.

## How to Run

You can use the api in two ways, cloning this repository or testing with our deploy running on Heroku

To clone the project, run the following command:

```git
git clone https://github.com/bruno-ruotolo/DrivenPass
```

Then, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:

```git
npm install
```

Finally, start the server:

```git
npm start
```

You can now access the API's endpoints by navigating to http://localhost:5000/

If you want to use the deployed API access: https://drivenpass-ruotolo.herokuapp.com
